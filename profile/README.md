# MARPLE: Explaining what happened through multi-modal simulation

Humans have a remarkable ability to figure out what happened. From a puddle of milk, we can infer that our roommate must have forgotten to close the fridge (again!), that the milk toppled over, and splashed on the floor. When humans infer what happened, they combine evidence from multiple modalities to do so. For example, jury members are often presented with a large variety of pieces of evidence that may include images of the crime scene, surveillance videos, audio recordings, and various kinds of testimony from different witnesses. The jury member's task is to take in all these sources of information and get at the truth of what happened. Current AI systems fail to match the inferential capacities of humans. While great strides have been made in developing models that understand and produce language, as well as models that process visual input, we believe that a key component is missing: we need AI systems that integrate different sources of evidence into a causal model of the world. Such a causal world model is necessary to give satisfactory explanations of what happened.

In this project, we will take major steps to bridge the gap between vision and language models in AI. We will develop MARPLE (named after the detective Miss Marple) - a computational framework that combines evidence from vision, audio, and language to produce human-understandable explanations of what happened. Current research in cognitive science shows that the human capacity to draw flexible inferences about the physical world, and about each other, is best explained by assuming that people construct mental causal models of the domain, and that they use these models to simulate different counterfactual possibilities. To give explanations of what happened, and to say what caused what, the capacity to go beyond what actually happened and simulate alternative possibilities is critical.

To explain what happened and why, humans build causal models of the world to mentally simulate how the current state of the world came about. MARPLE combines different forms of evidence with different environments to produce explanations of what happened.
